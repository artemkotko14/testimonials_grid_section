## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- SASS

### What I learned

I learned how to add image to background and adjust it to my needs:

```css
background-image: url("/images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg");
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: top right 1.5rem;
background-size: 7rem 7.4rem;
```

### Continued development

In my future projects I want to focus on making responsive designs with CSS Grid and using Sass extension.
